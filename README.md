# Yubo (Veronica) Chen - Portfolio Task

[My portfolio site](https://veronica-yubo-chen.github.io/YuboVeronicaChen.github.io/)

> If the link above returns 404, the GitHub Pages build may still be processing. Wait 2–3 minutes, then hard refresh (`Cmd+Shift+R`).

## GitHub Pages Notes

This repository name (`YuboVeronicaChen.github.io`) does not exactly match the GitHub username (`Veronica-Yubo-Chen`). Because of that, GitHub serves it as a project site under:

`https://veronica-yubo-chen.github.io/YuboVeronicaChen.github.io/`

### Want the shorter root domain?

1. Go to Settings → General → Rename repository to: `Veronica-Yubo-Chen.github.io`
2. Verify Settings → Pages shows Source: `main` and Folder: `/ (root)`
3. Access it at: `https://veronica-yubo-chen.github.io/`
4. Update the README link accordingly.

### Troubleshooting

- 404: Wait a few minutes; first build can be delayed.
- Still failing: Visit Settings → Pages and confirm the “Build and deployment” section is enabled.
- Cache issues: Use an incognito window or: `curl -I https://veronica-yubo-chen.github.io/YuboVeronicaChen.github.io/`
